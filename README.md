dropCategoryChange
======================

Create an n amount of DIV Elements with Unique ids and classes, furthermore n shapes with Unique colors, make ist possible to apply to an class mutliple ids. When you drop One of These colors onto a drop area, make ist Happen that all ids with with a selected class Out of n of your Choice apply to the Dropped Color.


Additions:


AJAX requesting on drop and clear,
ATM no Data Handling, just giving some unnessecary data to an php,
doSomeStuff with it and give it back via console.log on the clientside.

Nice to Have:

- ID Apply Feedback
- Class Apply Feedback
- changing multiple Classes (Form Rerendering)
- Feedback if no class is selected and so dropping is prevented
